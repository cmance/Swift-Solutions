1. Provide Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content: This includes using alt text for images, transcripts for audio, and captions for video.

2. Ensure Content is Perceivable: This includes providing alternatives for time-based media, using clear headings and labels, and making sure content is distinguishable through the use of color and audio control.

3. Make All Functionality Available from a Keyboard: This includes making sure all functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes.

4. Help Users Navigate and Find Content: This includes providing ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

5. Make Text Readable and Understandable: This includes using readable fonts and colors, making text resizable without assistive technology, and using plain language.

6. Design Forms to be Accessible: This includes ensuring all form elements are labeled properly and making sure form submission is error-free and easy to correct.

7. Use ARIA roles and properties: ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) can help with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls developed with JavaScript, HTML, and similar technologies.

In short, we should be adding alt tags to images to give a description of the image, making sure all content is accessible through a keyboard, and making sure all forms are easy to use and error-free. Aria labels can also be used to help with dynamic content and advanced user interface controls. Colors should have a distinct contrast to make sure all users can read the content.
