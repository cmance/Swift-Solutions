In order for these tests to run, you must enter:
dotnet run (in PopNGo.csproj)

into a seperate console and then type:
dotnet test (in PopNGo_BDD_Tests.csproj)

into another console with the corresponding projects being in the correct path.
I am unable to see the output in the testing tab of Visual Studio Code, but I can see that all the tests pass in the console after dotnet test is ran.
