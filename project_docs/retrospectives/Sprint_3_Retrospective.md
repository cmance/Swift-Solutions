# Sprint 3 Retrospective #

## Milestones: ##
- We combined the Map and Explore pages
- The site's look and feel was a lot more cohesive
- The searching is a lot more intuitive for locations

## Loved: ##
- The thoroughness of our Sprint Planning Meeting
- Confirming everyone's user stories before leaving the Sprint Planning Meeting

## Loathed: ##
- Josh's issue was way too large in scope, in hindsight
- Integration with merges was difficult due to scope

## Learned: ##
- We learned about setting up Jest, that it's less intuitive than we'd thought.
- How to be more cohesive with our naming and organization.
- Merge requests can be painful and introduce regressions.

## Longed For: ##
- Less regressions and having to re-do work
- More assistance with code review before merging

## Actions: ##
- When merging content into dev, the story owners should meet with Tristan when doing the merging
- Whenever people have free time, they should review open pull requests
